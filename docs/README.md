# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation hub. This repository contains the processes, guidelines, and best practices that enable our teams to deliver high-quality products efficiently and collaboratively.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management processes are built around clear roles, structured workflows, and a commitment to continuous improvement. The team operates with a strong emphasis on cross-functional collaboration, assigning defined responsibilities to core personas: Project Managers (PMs), Product Managers (PdMs), Developers, QA/Testing, and Stakeholders. Each role is detailed with specific goals and communication expectations, ensuring that project delivery, product prioritization, technical implementation, and quality validation are handled by the right people. This clarity in ownership and responsibility minimizes ambiguity and helps streamline project execution.

Key workflows follow a lifecycle model: initiation, planning, execution and tracking, release and deployment, and retrospective. The process begins with project initiation, where the business need is validated, stakeholders are identified, and high-level plans are formed. Planning turns ideas into actionable backlogs, using templates and checklists to break work into shippable increments and manage risks. During execution, teams use project boards to visualize progress, enforce small, reviewable pull requests, and conduct regular standups and delivery syncs. Quality assurance is integral, with unit, integration, and end-to-end testing requirements, CI-based security scans, and manual QA for feature acceptance.

Communication is structured and proactive. Regular cadences—such as daily standups, weekly syncs, and monthly stakeholder updates—ensure alignment and rapid escalation of issues. Risk and blocker escalation follows a transparent path from the team to PMs, then to product leads and sponsors if needed. Comprehensive documentation, including project charters, risk registers, and status templates, serve as single sources of truth and facilitate consistent information sharing.

Continuous improvement is embedded in the process through retrospectives after each sprint or milestone. Teams reflect on what went well, identify actionable improvements, and track follow-up items in the backlog. This feedback loop, combined with a focus on psychological safety and data-informed decisions, drives the evolution of OctoAcme's practices and ensures that every project benefits from collective learning and experience.
